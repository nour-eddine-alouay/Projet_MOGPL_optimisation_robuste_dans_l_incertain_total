# üß¨ README ‚Äî Commands Summary for PHYLIP TME (Exercises 2‚Äì5)

This README contains all commands and execution steps used across the PHYLIP exercises.  
It includes the sequence alignment, distance computation, tree reconstruction (NJ & UPGMA),  
and visualization steps for each exercise.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è General setup

Make sure **Clustal Omega** and **PHYLIP** are installed and accessible from your terminal or PowerShell.  
All PHYLIP programs (`protdist`, `neighbor`, etc.) must be run from inside the `phylip/exe` folder.

## üß© Exercise 2 ‚Äî Building NJ & UPGMA trees (PAH protein)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare and align sequences
```bash
clustalo -i PAH.fasta -o PAH.aln-phylip --outfmt=phylip
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Compute distance matrix
```bash
copy-item PAH.aln-phylip infile
protdist
rename-item outfile PAH_protdist.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build NJ tree
```bash
copy-item PAH_protdist.txt infile
neighbor
# When prompted about "outfile" existing ‚Üí type R
# Confirm settings ‚Üí Y
rename-item outfile PAH_NJ_log.txt
rename-item outtree PAH_NJ_tree.nwk
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build UPGMA tree
```bash
copy-item PAH_protdist.txt infile
neighbor
# Choose UPGMA (press N to toggle), then Y to confirm
rename-item outfile PAH_UPGMA_log.txt
rename-item outtree PAH_UPGMA_tree.nwk
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Files produced

## üå≥ Tree visualization

You can visualize `.newick` files with:

* **iTOL:** [https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi](https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi)
* **FigTree:** `figtree NJ_tree.newick`

Export your tree as `.png` or `.pdf` and include it in your report.

---

## ü™¥ Notes and good practices

* Always rename `outfile` and `outtree` after each run to avoid overwriting.
* When PHYLIP asks about existing `outfile`, **type `R`** (Replace).
* Use **Neighbor-Joining (NJ)** for realistic phylogenies, and **UPGMA** for comparison.
* Keep a clear directory structure for each exercise.
